### Description

Did you ever what to time something up to thousands of a second. This is not possible by using time() and timers at all. This little class (only uses 3 variables) can time up to a thousands of a second with your CPU clock frequency. There's a little example program also shows the difference between using:

{if VarX <> "" then} AND {if Len(VarX) <> 0 then}. The last one will execute between 20-25% faster. The timer can show this in fractions of a second.
